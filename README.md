# **Sentiment Analysis Using Sequential Models**

A powerful sentiment analysis model built using Multiple Sequential Models like (LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM) to classify text as positive or negative. This project demonstrates practical usage of embedding layers and sequential modeling.

# **Features**

- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, padding, and custom word index creation.
- Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vector representations.
- Recurrent Neural Network: Captures the sequential nature of text data using LSTM/GRU layers.
- Binary Classification: Predicts positive or negative sentiment of a given text input.

# **Technologies Used**

- Python: Core programming language.
- TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework for model building.
- NumPy & Pandas: Data manipulation and processing.
- Tensorboard: For Deep Learning Visualization.

# **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-rnn.git  
    cd sentiment-analysis-rnn
